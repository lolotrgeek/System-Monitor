# System Monitor

A rainmeter skin that monitors the system along with clock and weather. It is highly customized for my hardware.

based on [hwinfo rainmeter plugin](https://www.hwinfo.com/forum/Thread-Rainmeter-plug-in-for-HWiNFO)

## Requirements:

[hwinfo version 5.82](https://www.filehorse.com/download-hwinfo64/old-versions/)

[Rainmeter version 4.1](https://builds.rainmeter.net)

Executables can be found in this repository in the `/Resources` directory

## Install: 

First install the `/skins/HWiNFO_3.0.0.rmskin` file to load the dll into rainmeter

Then copy `/Skins/` from repository into `/Documents/Rainmeter/` and replace any existing files

## Layout:
To add layout move `rainmeter.ini` to the rainmeter layout path, then apply it in rainmeter.

Layout default path is `C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Rainmeter\Layouts\hwinfo`
